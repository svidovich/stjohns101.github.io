&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Heart Ministry program takes place the 3rd Tuesday of each month from 6:00-8:00. We open the evening with a community meal.<br/>
We have a food pantry which enables St. John's to give our customers free food supplies. At 7:00, we open our taxable item selection for qualified participants. The meal and pantry are open to everyone. <img align="right" src="../media/vegetablesXSmall.jpg"/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be included in the taxable merchandise give-away, customers must be Massillon residents, have a photo ID, and have an Ohio Direction card. Please bring your ID and direction card with you. Come join us in fellowship!
