&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>AS A CHURCH</strong>, we are committed to our mission of sharing our passion for Christ through worship, fellowship and outreach. We seek to value all people,
sharing love through valuable connections in Christ. We wish to form relationships based in the heart, and create a bond with you as a church family.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that God is still relevant today: through the teachings of his son,
the world can be a better place. By acting in kindness, selflessness and humility according to the teachings of Christ, we can compel a change in the community around us.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our duty as Christians to spread the love of Christ not only to our friends and neighbors, but to the world. Join us in our mission of showing love and kindness to everyone we meet!
